A Selection of Necessary and Useful Git Commands: a (sort of) Quick Reference
==============================================================================

Misc
-----------
Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit object name, show
only a partial prefix:
``` $ git log --abbrev-commit ```

Apply only the specified commit(s) to current branch:
``` $ git cherry-pick <commit> ```


A note on branching
--------------------
Remember, if you create new files in one branch, then switch to another branch *without commiting first*, those files will show in the newly checked-out branch.
Draft part

-------------
```
$ git checkout <branch>
$ git commit (-a vs * ..................)
$ git push
$ git init
```

Committing
------------
* Add file contents to the index . . . updates the index using the current
content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next
commit.
```
 $ git add <file(s)>
```

* Stores the current contents of the index in a new commit along with a log
message from the user describing the changes.  ... by using the -a switch with
the commit command to automatically "add" changes from all known files (i.e.
all files that are already listed in the index) and to automatically "rm" files
in the index that have been removed from the working tree, and then perform the
actual commit
 ```
 $ git commit <file(s)> [-m <message>]
 ```


Also:
* Merging branches
* Plumbing vs porcelain
* Command line vs graphical
* git clone
* link to setting up ssh key
* References and notes
  * Much of this is taken from the git manual pages, some verbatim.
